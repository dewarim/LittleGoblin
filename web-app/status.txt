 status of project Goblin

Iteration 1

Basic Functionality

You start the game with a goblin. You can fight one monster, Ork.
Both you and your opponent have the same chance of winning.
You can flee at any time, in which case you will be send back to the start
page, where you can start a new fight, being completely healed.
Winning a fight will net you 1 experience point.
Loosing a fight will gain you an entry in the highscore list, which
is sorted according to experience points.
No matter if you loose or win, the game will start over and you can
gain more experience points. Between fights, both combatants are set
to 10 hit points.

Iteration 2
Automatic refresh of fight-page.
Problem to solve:
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;URL=/goblin/fight/fight?pc=${pc.id}&mob=${mob.id}"/>
does work,
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5;URL=/goblin/fight/fight?pc=${pc.id};mob=${mob.id}"/>
