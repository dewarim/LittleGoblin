# Release notes for Little Goblin v 0.3.2

Little Goblin is a browser game framework written with the Grails framework
using Groovy, Java and JavaScript. It includes a reference implementation
for testing and demonstration which will create a basic usable
game environment as seen on the test server on http://schedim.de

## Getting started

For instructions to install the binary version, see: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

* Checkout the source code from Github:

    git clone git@github.com:dewarim/LittleGoblin.git

* Edit goblin-config.example.groovy according to your database settings and serverURL

* Start the application with

    grails run-app

* Visit http://localhost:8080/goblin after the startup phase has completed.

## Further steps

You can include Little Goblin as a plugin in your own Grails application.
In BuildConfig, just add ":goblin:0.3.2" to the plugin section.*

    * note: this will work once the plugin is released.

Then you can adjust the CSS, layout and overall design as well as the
inner game mechanics. If you have any questions or want to contribute,
do not hesitate to ask or raise an issue.
