/**
 * Test class for TickServiceSpec.
 * This test will work, but afterwards you can expect to see exceptions in the form of:
 * {@code
 * de.dewarim.goblin.ticks.TickRunner Tick failed: [Method on class [de.dewarim.goblin.ticks.Tick]
 * was used outside of a Grails application.
 * If running in the context of a test using the mocking API or bootstrap Grails correctly.]
 * }
 * It seems like the test framework has problems with transactions running in GPars Actors.
 * In production use, this code can be observed to work: the actors are called and generate the
 * expected log output. Still, a proper test would be better.
