/**
 * Features allow Items to have scripts associated with them which the user can execute by activating
 * the item. For example, a healing potion will have a healing feature which upon execution adds
 * one or more health points to a player character.<br>
 * This class enables the creation of item types which
 * A Feature object defines a reference to a script class which implements the ICombatScript interface.
 * At the moment, items may be activated only during combat. An item with an associated Feature will have
 * a link or button to click upon which is labeled with the I18n-ed name of the feature. Once the link
 * is clicked, the script is executed and creates the desired effect (if appropriate in the current situation,
 * for example, a drain life spell should not work on an undead monster).
