 *  An Academy is a place where PCs may learn new Skills / SkillSets.
 * Currently, there is a 1:n mapping of Academy to SkillSets. One expansion
 * option is to add a course class which contains price and learning time of
 * SkillSets. But that is probably additional complexity without much play value,
 * unless there are different towns with multiple academies.
 *
 *
 * An Academy may be associated with a guild, and if that's the case, a PC may only
 * learn skills there if he is a member.
