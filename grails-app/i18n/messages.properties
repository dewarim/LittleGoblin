equipmentSlotType.intro=An equipment slot type is an attribute which helps to determine if an object can be used by a player \
  or mob. For example, a hand held weapon would need one or more hands to hold it, so it can only be used by a creature which \
  has a free hand. The technical term in Little Goblin for this is "equipment slot". \
  An equipment slot needs a type, as a creature (or space ship) may have more than one of a specific kind - like, two hands \
  or 4 weapon bays. <br> \
  When a player character is created, it will receive the appropriate number of equipment slots.<br> When you create new \
  Item Types, you can also assign them specific slot requirements (for example, a helmet requires a free "head slot").

feature.admin.headline=Features
feature.admin.intro=Features allow Items to have scripts associated with them which the user can execute by activating \
  the item. For example, a healing potion will have a healing feature which upon execution adds one or more \
  health points to a player character.<br>\
  A Feature object defines a reference to a script class which implements the ICombatScript interface. \
  At the moment, items may be activated only during combat. An item with an associated Feature will have \
  a link or button to click, which is labeled with the localized name of the feature. \
  Once the link is clicked, the script is executed and creates the desired effect (if appropriate in the \
  current situation, for example, a drain life spell should not work on an undead monster).

itemFeature.admin.intro=ItemFeature objects combine item types and features instances with a specific configuration. This way, \
  you can reuse a feature script by adding a configuration depending on the item type. For example, if you have a healing \
  feature script defined, you can now create potions of lesser, normal and greater healing by adding the appropriate \
  configuration and binding it to the item type of each potion class.
