h2. Checkout the source code

You can get the source code from the "Little Goblin GitHub repository":https://github.com/dewarim/LittleGoblin

It is available as a "zip or tar archive":https://github.com/dewarim/LittleGoblin/downloads or (recommended) 
as a git repository which you can clone via  
bq. git clone git://github.com/dewarim/LittleGoblin.git

h3. Prerequisites to running from source

* you need Java, a database and the configuration file - see [Binary install instructions|guide:installation/binary].
* Grails - which you will find on "Grails.org":http://grails.org

After you have installed the dependencies, use the command line to run Grails in Little Goblin's main directory:
@grails@ and start the application with @run-app@

h3. Use as a plugin

Add the following line to your Grails application's BuildConfig.groovy (in the plugins section):

{code}
    compile ':little-goblin:0.3.2'
{code}

As a starting point, look at the BootStrap.groovy code in the plugin's source on how to populate the database
with essential objects like an admin user. You can login to your application via http://localhost:8080/$appName/portal/landing,
where $appName stands for your Grails application's name. Then it's time to begin customizing the game engine and 
to add your own content. (Extensive documentation on how to do this will follow - if anything is unclear or does not work,
please to not hesitate to "ask or add an issue":https://github.com/dewarim/LittleGoblinDoc/issues/ )
