Items are among the most complex features of Little Goblin. 
A player character may own any number of them, and they may have special uses and effects which can be activated
 when the time is right.
 
h2. Item types

All items have a specific item type which defines:

h3. Required slots

To equip an item (so it can be used), one or more free equipment slots are necessary.
An equipment slot may be a body part (an iron helmet requires a free head slot) or,
in a later version of the framework, a space ship (a photon torpedo needs a weapons bay).

Current equipment slot types (in the reference implementation - you are free to change them in
your game):

* head
* neck
* body
* hand
* finger
* legs
* feet

A character may have more than one of each slot type (of course, having two heads only makes
sense if you play an Ettin...)

h3. Attributes

An item may have any number of item attributes. A sword of flames will have a weapon attribute of type
"fire" and a corresponding damage modified. Combat attributes are used to calculate damage - a sword of 
fire will do more damage against an ice monster. 

Current combat attributes include:

* fire
* acid
* water
* cold
* electricity
* death
* light
* chaos
* sound
* poison
* shards
* normal

h3. Item categories

Categories are used group items according to their basic aspects, you can think of them as tags for 
item properties. For example, a magic potion of healing will belong to the categories 'potion' and 'magic'
- and perhaps 'healing', if you expect to have a lot of healing items. Shops will not always carry 
items of all categories and some may in fact only carry potions or weapons.

Initial item categories (for the handful of test items):
 
* potion
* magic
* mushroom
* metal
* armor
* weapon
 
h3. Combat damage

A weapon is simply defined as an item which has a combat dice value set. Dice determine the base
damage an item will do via the formula ( number of sides * number of dice) + bonus value. You can name
your dice and reuse them for different items, for example "Dice: short swords" or "Dice: Phasers".

h3 Stackable and package size

Items may be combined to stacks. The package size determines the amount of this items you will receive
from a shop keeper. For example, buying "a dozen arrows" will add a stack of 12 arrows to your quiver.

h3. Usable and rechargeable items

Some items can be used (activated) to create special effects, which may consume the item or reduce its
 life expectancy by one. A potion will have only one use, while a laser blaster may have a 100 shots
  before it can be recharged.

h3. Value and availability

Availability is currently defined in 0.1% steps - so it's a number from 0 to 1000. Items with an 
  availability of zero will never be found in a shop, while others will be on sale some or all the time.
The base value of an item is used to calculate the price a shop keeper will pay for it.

h2. Item properties

An item has other properties besides its type. Those are:

* an owner: a Creature (may be a mob, but most likely it's a player character)
* a location: currently, two location types are defined: ON_PERSON and AT_HOME
* a gold value: game events may change the value of an item.
* amount: for stacked items, default is 1
* equipped flag: true if the item is currently in use.
* number of uses left
* resources: an item may be designed to be used as a production resource in crafting.
    A player may choose between several stacks of raw materials to use for a product,
    and the chosen stack is marked internally for consumption.
