Combat in Little Goblin currently is the fight between a player character and a monster or, 
 in the case of the Grand Melee (see below) between all willing player characters. A fight is started
 by meeting a monster during a quest encounter. The fight will go on until the player wins, flees or
 is defeated.
 
Combat is round-based. At the moment, the player has the option to 

* use items from his or her inventory
* to attack the opponent
* run away

Running away is always successful and terminates the current quest.
Attacking uses the currently equipped weapon(s) and passive abilities to determine the effects
  on the opponent. 
  
h3. A closeup of a fight

A round of combat consists of the following steps:

* determine initiative (rolling a d20 at the moment, add bonuses)
* attacker rolls to strike
* defender rolls to parry
* in case of a hit, compute damage from all items that contribute to damage dealt.
* check if both combatants are alive
* counter attack of the defender (strike, parry, deal damage, check result)
* either finish the combat sequence or start a new round

h4. Special damage and mitigation

Items or a creature's natural abilities may deal special damage (for example, a dragon breathing fire).
This is included via a damage multiplier, so a dragon may deal fire damage which increases its base
damage by a factor of 1.2. If this dragon is also for some reason a creature of chaos, it may increase
the damage further by another factor of 1.3. Likewise, the abilities or items of a fighter may reduce
the damage dealt by a certain factor. A ring of protection from chaos may reduce damage with chaotic
influence by a factor of 0.5 (so chaos damage is reduced by 50%).
 
Note that in this simple combat model an armor of protection from fire will reduce the _total_ damage, 
not the percentage of the damage that is actually dealt be heat. So, attacking a creature that is virtually
immune to fire with a +20 burning sword of [fire,death,chaos,poison] is not the best strategy.

h3. The Grand Melee

The Grand Melee is Highlander-style combat scenario where all participants will fight each other
until only the winner is left standing. It is round based with a fixed timeout to prevent players
  from waiting too long before committing to an action. (If a player does not submit an action,
  his character will attack a random opponent).
